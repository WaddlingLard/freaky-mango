# Lab 7

## Overview

This is a faithful recreation of the provided template in the Lab! I enjoyed understanding the layouts and this motivates me to make something of my own. I'd like to start making a custom website once this course is done! :)

In my code I actually have both solutions implemented for flex and grid but I decided to use a flex for the article. The photos was more tricky using a flex as I'm not sure how to setup gaps so I decided on using a grid template.

Steps to run the website:
1. To get this website running, first download this repository to your local directory.
2. Navigate to where it is located on your computer and then open VSCode.
3. Then, using Live Preview, use the key combination ctrl+shift+p and use the command 'Live Preview: Start Server'.
4. If you want to access the website via a web browser. User the url 'localhost:3000' to view the website.
